# Code of Conduct - Austin Automation Professionals

All events organized by the Austin Automation Professionals Meetup are open to everyone regardless of race, nationality, religious beliefs, disability, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical appearance, age, body size, or skill level.

The AAP is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the AAP organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, skill level, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any AAP communication channel.

Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Organizers, sponsors, and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the AAP organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the AAP community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an AAP organizer immediately.

If you have questions, feedback, or revisions about this Code of Conduct please submit a pull-request or reach out to us.
